The canonical repo owns the vocabulary — **vTwin · Kited · Kited Twin · the String · Tethered ·
Kited Neighborhood · Neighbor · Scan‑to‑Join · Sealed · Doorman · Cloud Neighborhood** — and the
**kite mark**, alongside its companion canonical repos:

| Repo | Owns |
|------|------|
| [rapp-neighborhood-protocol](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-neighborhood-protocol) | the spec + vocabulary |
| [rapp-sealed](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-sealed) | the `rapp-sealed/1.0` AES‑256‑GCM codec + conformance vectors |
| [kite-mark](https://github.com/kody-w/kite-mark) | the kite mark (visual identity) |

This file is intentionally a pointer. The vBrainstem **inlines** the sealed codec and the kite mark
(it's zero‑dependency, single‑file); the `neighborhood-canon` CI check fails if those inlined copies
drift from the canonical repos above.
